# ReactiveTransportAnalyser
# Reactive Transport Analyzer for CO₂ Reactions

## Overview

This repository contains a suite of tools and scripts designed to analyze reactive transport processes involving CO₂ reactions in carbonate aquifers and well cement. The suite is based on research presented at the 25th Annual Imperial College Pore-Scale Imaging and Modelling Consortium, focusing on the interaction of CO₂ with multimineral carbonate systems and well cement.

## Key Features

- **Multimineral Carbonate Dissolution Analysis**: Tools to analyze the impact of mineral spatial distribution on CO₂ dissolution rates in carbonate rocks.
- **Cement Dissolution and Precipitation Analysis**: Tools to investigate the effect of dissolution and precipitation on cement permeability during exposure to CO₂ and carbonic acid.
- **Experimental Data Integration**: Integration of experimental data from CO₂ flooding apparatus and micro-CT scans.
- **Reaction Rate Analysis**: Analysis of effective reaction rates considering mass transfer limitations and mineral spatial distribution.
